name: Issue
about: A bug, a feature, a refactor, tooling or docs. Pick the label from CONTRIBUTING.md.
---

<!--
This file is the rule for an issue's body, not only its shape. CONTRIBUTING.md links
here instead of restating it.

Copy this file, fill in every section, and delete the comments. Give the issue
exactly one label from CONTRIBUTING.md's table (bug / enhancement / refactor /
chore / documentation); the branch prefix follows it.

What may appear in a public artifact is PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT.md's subject. The short
version: describe a project the evidence came from by its shape, never by its name;
no machine paths anywhere, quoted output included; write so that somebody who has
never seen this machine can act on it.
-->

## Problem

<!--
What happens, on what input. For a bug, the command and the output, verbatim. For a
report from using htl on a project, the project's shape (size, how it is hosted,
which htl version) and not its name. For an enhancement, what cannot be done today.
For a refactor, what in the code is wrong while the behaviour is right.
-->

## Evidence

<!--
Measured, not assumed. A timing says which build (debug or release) produced it and
what it was measured on. A type error quotes the line. A claim read from the code
gives `file:line` and says that it was read, not reproduced.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
Optional. Say which kind of answer the issue asks for: a patch, an architecture
change, a narrower requirement, or "not now". Alternatives and why they lose belong
here too.
-->

## Acceptance

<!--
A numbered list. Each item is a criterion somebody can check, stated as what `htl
check` / `htl test` / the CLI / the library prints or does when the issue is done,
with the expected output where there is one.

The pull request quotes these items by number in its Acceptance table and shows,
for each, the expected output and the actual output
(.github/pull_request_template.md). An item nobody can check that way ("works
better", "is cleaner") is not a criterion; say what would be printed instead.

For a refactor, one item is "behaviour unchanged", with what is compared to show it.
